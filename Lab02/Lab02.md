<h1> 4ID3 Lab 02 - Bluetooth Communication</h1>
<h2>2023 - 01 - 24</h2>
n this lab, we explored using the BluetoothSerial library to
communicate sensor data from an ESP32 microcontroller to a PC.
The data was formatted as a JSON string and parsed by a Python
application on the PC. The data was then either published over
MQTT or inserted into a local MongoDB database for further analysis.
